  "description": "Read and strictly follow `skills/workflow-discovery/SKILL.md`. Investigate one team member's Slack history who you have NOT investigated recently (check `crons/workflow-discovery/discovery.md`). Analyze their recurring manual tasks, repeated questions, and pain points. Identify at least 2-3 concrete automation opportunities that could save them real time. If an automation is clearly valuable, propose it via DM with a specific, personalized message — not a generic one. Examples of good proactive suggestions: 'I noticed you post Stripe revenue every Monday — want me to automate that?', 'You've asked about open PRs 4 times this week — want me to set up a daily summary?'. Only reach out if you have something genuinely useful to say. Log who you investigated and what you found in `crons/workflow-discovery/discovery.md`.",
