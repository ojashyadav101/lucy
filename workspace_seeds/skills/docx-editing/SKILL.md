# DOCX Editing

Create and modify Word documents using Python in the code execution sandbox.

## Recommended Library
- **python-docx** — full control over document structure, styles, tables, and images

## Workflow

1. Understand the document requirements (template, content, formatting)
2. Create or load the document
3. Add/modify content (paragraphs, tables, images, headers)
4. Apply styling (fonts, colors, spacing)
5. Save and share

## Best Practices

- Use document styles rather than direct formatting for consistency
- Handle images with proper aspect ratios
- Test page breaks with realistic content length
- For templates, use placeholder text that's easy to find-and-replace
