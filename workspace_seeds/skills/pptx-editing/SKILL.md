# PPTX Editing

Create and modify PowerPoint presentations using Python in the code execution sandbox.

## Recommended Library
- **python-pptx** — full control over slides, layouts, shapes, charts, and formatting

## Workflow

1. Understand the presentation requirements (audience, purpose, key messages)
2. Plan the slide structure (outline before building)
3. Create slides with proper layouts
4. Add content (text, images, charts, tables)
5. Apply consistent styling
6. Save and share

## Best Practices

- Start with a slide master/template for consistent branding
- Keep slides focused — one key idea per slide
- Use speaker notes for detailed talking points
- Test with the actual projector/screen aspect ratio (16:9 vs 4:3)
- For data-heavy slides, generate charts from real data
