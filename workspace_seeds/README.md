# Workspace Seeds

Template files copied into each workspace on first setup.

- `skills/` — Platform skill definitions (SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter)
- `crons/` — Default cron task definitions (task.json per cron)

During onboarding, Lucy copies these seeds into the workspace filesystem
and then customizes them based on the team's context.
