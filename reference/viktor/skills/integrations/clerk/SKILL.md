## Pipedream Proxy Helpers

When this integration has limited pre-built actions, use these authenticated HTTP helpers:

- `pd_clerk_proxy_get`
- `pd_clerk_proxy_post`
- `pd_clerk_proxy_put`
- `pd_clerk_proxy_patch`
- `pd_clerk_proxy_delete`

Start with read-only requests and add write calls only when needed.
