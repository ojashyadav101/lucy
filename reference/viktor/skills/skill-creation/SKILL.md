name: skill-creation
description: Create reusable skills with proper structure and frontmatter. Use when creating or editing a skill or workflow.
---

When you develop a reusable workflow, save it as a skill within the relevant domain/topic folder.

## Skill Directory Structure

```
{domain}/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md     # Required: What it does, when/how to use, best practices
├── scripts/     # Optional: Utility scripts for the skill
├── references/  # Optional: Additional documentation (loaded on demand)
└── assets/      # Optional: Templates, images, data files
```

## SKILL.md Format

Every SKILL.md file must contain YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: [What it does]. Use when [trigger conditions].
---

Instructions and best practices go here...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field         | Required | Description                                                               |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | Yes      | Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must match the folder name. |
| `description` | Yes      | What the skill does + when the agent should use it.                       |

### Name Field Rules

- Only lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`a-z`, `0-9`, `-`)
- Must not start or end with `-`
- Must not contain consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match the parent directory name exactly

Examples:
- ✓ `pdf-creation` → `pdf-creation/`
- ✓ `excel-editing` → `excel-editing/`
- ✗ `PDF-Creation` (uppercase not allowed)
- ✗ `-pdf` (cannot start with hyphen)

### Description Field Guidelines

The description must include **what** the skill does and **when** to use it. Keep it under 1024 characters.

Structure: `[What it does]. Use when [trigger phrases].`

Good examples:
```yaml
description: Creates PDF documents from HTML/CSS. Use when creating PDFs, reports, or formatted documents.
description: Validates and modifies Excel files. Use when editing or modifying Excel (.xlsx) files.
description: Adds digital signatures to PDFs. Use when signing PDFs or adding signatures to documents.
```

Poor examples:
```yaml
# Too vague, no trigger phrases
description: Helps with PDFs.
# Missing what it does, too implementation-focused
description: Create professional PDF documents from HTML/CSS using WeasyPrint.
# Too broad, will over-trigger
description: Processes documents.
```

To prevent over-triggering, add negative triggers when the skill could be confused with similar skills:
```yaml
description: Validates and modifies Excel files. Use when editing .xlsx files. Do NOT use for CSV exports (use data-export skill instead).
```

## Body Content

After the frontmatter, structure the body as:

1. **Instructions** - step-by-step workflow, ordered by execution sequence
2. **Examples** - concrete scenarios showing input, actions, and expected result
3. **Edge cases** - common pitfalls and how to handle them
4. **Troubleshooting** (optional) - only include for skills that interact with external tools or APIs where errors are observed by any viktor instance. Use the format: Error > Cause > Solution.

Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to `references/` and link to it explicitly from the body so the agent knows when to load it:
```markdown
Before generating the document, consult `references/style-guide.md` for brand colors and typography.
```

## Bundling Scripts

When a workflow step requires deterministic validation or data extraction, bundle a script in `scripts/` instead of relying on natural language instructions. Code is deterministic; language interpretation isn't.

Good candidates for scripts:
- **Validation** - checking file structure, formulas, required fields
- **Data extraction** - parsing styles from websites, extracting metadata from files
- **Transformation** - format conversion, data normalization

How to bundle a script:
1. Place the script in `{skill-name}/scripts/`
2. Reference it from SKILL.md with the exact invocation command
3. Document what the script does, its flags, and expected output

Example from `excel-editing`:
```markdown
After creating/modifying Excel files with formulas, validate them:
\`\`\`bash
uv run python skills/excel-editing/scripts/validate_excel.py output.xlsx
uv run python skills/excel-editing/scripts/validate_excel.py output.xlsx --recalc
\`\`\`
```

The script should never modify the original file. Keep scripts focused on a single responsibility.

## Example Skill

```markdown
---
name: data-export
description: Exports structured data to common file formats. Use when exporting data to CSV, Excel, or JSON.
---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Determine output format
Ask the user which format they need. Default to CSV for tabular data.

### Step 2: Export

Use pandas for CSV exports:

\`\`\`python
import pandas as pd
df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
\`\`\`

For Excel with formatting, use openpyxl...

## Examples

User says: "Export the campaign data as a spreadsheet"
Actions:
1. Load campaign data into a DataFrame
2. Export as .xlsx with column headers
Result: Excel file with formatted campaign data
```

## Where to Create Skills

- **Domain-specific skills**: Create in the domain folder (e.g., `paid_ads/campaign-analysis/`)
- **General-purpose skills**: Create in `skills/` (e.g., `skills/pdf-creation/`)
