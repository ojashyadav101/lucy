  "description": "You monitor the #mentions Slack channel (ID: C08QW134RKN) for new conversations about potential bugs, issues, or feature requests.\n\n## Your workflow:\n\n### 1. Read new messages\n- Read the latest messages from `slack/mentions/` log files\n- Check the state file at `/work/crons/mentions-issue-monitor/state.json` to see which messages you've already processed\n- Only process messages newer than the last processed timestamp\n\n### 2. Analyze conversations\n- Look for discussions that describe problems, bugs, issues, feature requests, or improvements\n- Ignore casual chat, greetings, status updates, or messages that don't describe actionable work\n- Pay attention to screenshots/images shared (Slack file URLs) \u2014 these are important evidence\n- Group related messages in the same thread as one potential issue\n\n### 3. If you detect a potential issue\n- Post a message IN the #mentions channel (C08QW134RKN) \u2014 NOT in DM \u2014 replying in the relevant thread if applicable\n- Summarize what you detected and ask if they'd like to create a Linear ticket\n- Use a permission_request message with a draft for creating the Linear issue\n- The draft should use `linear_create_issue` with:\n  - team: \"Mentions App\" (ID: 85af8f8d-4910-44e1-a166-18ab63a1fd26)\n  - Appropriate title, description (include context from the conversation)\n  - Appropriate labels from: Bug, Feature, Enhancement, Improvement, Task, Easy, Important, Analytics Page, etc.\n  - Priority based on urgency discussed (1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low)\n  - Status: \"Backlog\" by default\n- If screenshots were shared, download them with `coworker_download_from_slack` and after the issue is created, attach them with `linear_create_attachment`\n\n### 4. Update state\n- After processing, update `/work/crons/mentions-issue-monitor/state.json` with the latest processed timestamp\n- Even if no issues were found, update the timestamp so we don't reprocess\n\n## Linear workspace context:\n- Team: \"Mentions App\" (85af8f8d-4910-44e1-a166-18ab63a1fd26)\n- Users: Ojash Yadav (f3fc4e0f), Shashwat Singh (e4f369c0), Naman (e7a0e1ca), Pankaj (5a30e459)\n- Key labels: Bug (45d3e98d), Feature (af3b2fa7), Enhancement (643e2ecf), Improvement (ec27e607), Task (96153c87), Easy (48865987), Important (f2936643)\n- Statuses: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done, Canceled\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always check state file first to avoid duplicate processing\n- Be conservative \u2014 only flag clear issues, not every message\n- Include all relevant context from the conversation in the issue description\n- If multiple people discuss the same issue, combine their inputs\n- Don't create issues for messages from Viktor/bots\n",
